# Task-Automation-With-Python

In this task, I created a simple Python automation script that moves all .jpg files from one folder to another. The project demonstrates how Python can be used to automate everyday repetitive tasks, such as organizing files. I used Python’s built-in os and shutil libraries to list files in a source folder, check their file extensions, and then move only the .jpg files to a separate destination folder. Before moving the files, the script also checks if the destination folder exists and creates it if necessary. This project helped me understand the basics of file handling, working with directories, and applying conditional logic in Python. It’s a beginner-friendly script but very useful in organizing data and building a foundation for more advanced automation workflows. I plan to extend this script to handle other file types and include additional features like logging or copying instead of moving files.
